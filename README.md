# SWAT-_DTLs
This repository contains the Decision Tables that I have either created myself or borrowed from SWAT+ Editor DTL library.
Feel free to use them in your simulations, provide feedback/commits to the existing DTLs.
## 
Please do not forget to cite the correct source of the DTL you are using. Each DTL will have information in the header. They are either created by me or borrowed from SWAT+ DTL Library.
